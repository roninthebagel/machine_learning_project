## --- defining the model with tidymodel ---

Why is linear regression an appropriate starting point for this biological question?

- a straightforward approach to quantifying relationships between variables

What assumptions are we making about the relationship between methylation levels and age?

- assuming changes in methylation at specific CpG sites correlate linearly with age

What other preprocessing steps might be helpful when working with methylation data?
- removing highly correlated CpG sites to reduce redundancy
- scaling (standardising) methylation values if they have very different variances 
- transforming skewed methylation distributions
- imputing missing values if some CpG sites have gaps
