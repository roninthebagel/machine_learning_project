# the project:
this case study looks at bat methylation data, and here weâ€™ll demonstrate how these components work together to answer a specific biological question: 
- can DNA methylation patterns accurately predict bat age?
We will also test which model (initial tidymodel, and the train/test models) has the best predictive capability.

# analysis notes:
this single text file document includes the questions and answers to the "stop and think" segemnts in the workbook.
