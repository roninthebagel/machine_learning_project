# machine_learning_project

this repository contains a scripts folder which contains: 
- a scripts folder containing several r-studio scripts; one per chapter (as labelled) plus one with the used required packages and another with the data tidying methods
- a figures folder with all created plots, including data plots and model comparison plots
- a data folder with the raw data (pre-tidying)
- the text file, "analysis_notes", containing the questions and answers to the "stop and think" segments in the workbook.


# the project:
this case study looks at bat methylation data, and here weâ€™ll demonstrate how these components work together to answer a specific biological question: 
- can DNA methylation patterns accurately predict bat age?

We will also test which model (initial tidymodel, and the train/test models) has the best predictive capability.
