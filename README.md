# machine_learning_project

This repository includes: 
- A scripts folder which contains several r-studio scripts; one per chapter (as labelled) plus one with the used required packages ("required_packages.R") and another with the data tidying methods ("data_tidying.R")
- A figures folder with all created plots, which includes data plots and model comparison plots
- A data folder which includes the initial (pre-tidying) raw data ("DNA methylation data.xlsm") 
- A text file labelled "analysis_notes", which contains the questions and answers to the "stop and think" segments in the workbook


# The Project:
This case study looks at bat methylation data, and here weâ€™ll demonstrate how these components work together to answer a specific biological question: 
- Can DNA methylation patterns accurately predict bat age?


# Model Comparisons:
We will also test which model (initial tidymodel, and the train/test models) has the best predictive capability. Within this project, we will investigate the following models:
- Linear regression model
- Ridge model
- Lasso model
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression model
